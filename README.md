# kernel-adaptive-filtering

Implementation of different algorithms for adaptive filtering 
tested with two problems:

- Non linear channel equalization.
- Lorenz Oscillator

Progress:

- [x] Least Mean Square
- [x] Kernel Least Mean Square
- [x] Quantized Kernel Least Mean Square
- [x] Affine projection algorithms 1
- [x] Affine projection algorithms 2
- [x] Affine projection algorithms 3
- [x] Affine projection algorithms 4
- [x] Kernel Affine projection algorithms 1
- [x] Kernel Affine projection algorithms 2
- [ ] Kernel Affine projection algorithms 3
- [ ] Kernel Affine projection algorithms 4
- [x] Recursive Least Mean Square (untested)
- [x] Kernel Recursive Least Mean Square
- [x] Crossentropy - KLMS

All the implementations are based on the book "KERNEL ADAPTIVE FILTERING: A Comprehensive Introduction"
